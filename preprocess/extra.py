The beta and gamma actins co-exist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton and as mediators of internal cell motility. Actin gamma 1, encoded by this gene, is a cytoplasmic actin found in all cell types. Mutations in this gene are associated with DFNA20/26, a subtype of autosomal dominant non-syndromic sensorineural progressive hearing loss and also with Baraitser-Winter syndrome.

S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein is widely expressed in various types of tissues with a high expression level in thyroid gland. In smooth muscle cells, this protein co-expresses with other family members in the nucleus and in stress fibers, suggesting diverse functions in signal transduction. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]."),
    ENSG00000109062 = dict(query="ENSG00000109062",symbol="SLC9A3R1",summary="This gene encodes a sodium/hydrogen exchanger regulatory cofactor. The protein interacts with and regulates various proteins including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and G-protein coupled receptors such as the beta2-adrenergic receptor and the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor. The protein also interacts with proteins that function as linkers between integral membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. The protein localizes to actin-rich structures including membrane ruffles, microvilli, and filopodia. Mutations in this gene result in hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis type 2, and loss of heterozygosity of this gene is implicated in breast cancer. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009]."),

CCK-8, EDU, and colony formation assays demonstrated that SNHG25 knockdown markedly inhibited glioma cell proliferation. In vivo studies showed that SNHG25 knockdown significantly inhibited tumor growth. Further studies indicated that SNHG25 positively regulated MAP2K2 through sponging miR-579-5p. High expression of SNHG25 activated MAPK signaling through MAP2K2. These data suggest that SNHG25 is a potential target and biomarker for glioma. [Gene Card]."),

The protein functions as a scaffolding/adaptor protein in concert with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 to mediate activation of NF-kB in response to upstream signals. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding either the same or different isoforms have been identified for this gene. Mutations in this gene result in sporadic and familial Paget disease of bone. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]."),
    ENSG00000231925 = dict(query="ENSG00000231925",symbol="TAPBP",summary="This gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein which mediates interaction between newly assembled major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), which is required for the transport of antigenic peptides across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This interaction is essential for optimal peptide loading on the MHC class I molecule. Up to four complexes of MHC class I and this protein may be bound to a single TAP molecule. This protein contains a C-terminal double-lysine motif (KKKAE) known to maintain membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. This gene lies within the major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6. Alternative splicing results in three transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]."),
